# AWS Lambda Extensions
[![AWS Lambda extensions](/img/Extensions-LP-Header.png)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-extensions-in-preview/)

AWS Lambda Extensions are a new way for tools to more easily integrate deeply into the Lambda execution environment to control and participate in Lambdaâ€™s lifecycle. 

You can use extensions to integrate your Lambda functions with your preferred monitoring, observability, security, and governance tools. You can choose from a broad set of tools provided by AWS Lambda partners or you can create your own Lambda extensions.

Extensions use the Extensions API, a new HTTP interface, to register for lifecycle events and get greater control during function initialization, invocation, and shutdown. They can also use environment variables to add options and tools to the runtime, or use wrapper scripts to customize the runtime startup behavior.

For more information on using the features of Lambda extensions, see [Using AWS Lambda extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/using-extensions.html).

## Sample extension demos and examples

In this repository you will find a number of demos and sample projects from AWS and AWS Partners to help you get started with building your own extensions.

## AWS examples

### Extension Demos

* [AWS AppConfig](awsappconfig-extension-demo/): A demo showing how Lambda uses an extension with  [AWS AppConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html) as explained in the blog post [Introducing Lambda Extensions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-extensions-in-preview/). 

* [Custom runtime extension](custom-runtime-extension-demo/): A demo showing how to learn about the Extensions API as explained in the blog post [Building Extensions for AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-extensions-for-aws-lambda-in-preview/).

* [Caching Extension](cache-extension-demo/): The cache demo code sample is written in Go and acts as a companion process which a Lambda function can use as both a data cache (using DynamoDB) and configuration cache (using Systems Manager Parameter Store).


### Extension examples by language

### Logs API demos and example extensions

* [Go Logs API extension](go-example-logs-api-extension/): How to get a basic Logs API extension written in Go up and running. This extension demonstrates registering for the INVOKE and SHUTDOWN events using the Extensions API. It then runs a local HTTP listener and subscribes to a stream of function and platform logs using the Logs API. It buffers them and sends them to S3 periodically.

* [Python Logs API extension](python-example-logs-api-extension/): How to get a basic Logs API extension written in Go up and running. This extension demonstrates registering for the INVOKE and SHUTDOWN events using the Extensions API. It then runs a local HTTP listener and subscribes to a stream of function and platform logs using the Logs API. It buffers them and sends them to S3 periodically.

* [Python for Elasticsearch Logs API extension](python-example-elasticsearch-extension/): How to get a basic Logs API extension for Elasticsearch written in Python 3 up and running. This extension demonstrates registering for the INVOKE and SHUTDOWN events using the Extensions API. It then runs a local HTTP listener and subscribes to a stream of function and platform logs using the Logs API. It buffers them and sends them to Elasticsearch periodically.

* [Node.js Logs API extension](nodejs-example-logs-api-extension/): How to get a basic Logs API extension written in Go up and running. This extension demonstrates registering for the INVOKE and SHUTDOWN events using the Extensions API. It then runs a local HTTP listener and subscribes to a stream of function and platform logs using the Logs API. It buffers them and sends them to S3 periodically.

* [Demo: Logs to Amazon S3 extension: zip archive](s3-logs-extension-demo-zip-archive/): Demo logs extension to receive logs directly from Lambda and send them to S3, see the blog post [Using AWS Lambda extensions to send logs to custom destinations](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-aws-lambda-extensions-to-send-logs-to-custom-destinations/). The demo is deployed using AWS SAM. 

* [Demo: Logs to Amazon S3 extension: container image ](s3-logs-extension-demo-container-image/): Demo logs extension to receive logs directly from Lambda and send them to S3. This example packages the extension and function as separate container images. The demo is deployed using AWS SAM.

* [Demo: Logs to Kinesis firehose Logs API extension](kinesisfirehose-logs-extension-demo/): How to get a basic logs API extension for Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose written in Go. The extension explains the overall approach to streamline and centralize log collection using Amazon Kinesis Data firehose. The extension runs a local HTTP listener and subscribes to a stream of function and platform logs using the Logs API. It buffers them and sends them to Amazon Kinesis Data firehose periodically, which streams logs to Amazon S3. The demo gets deployed using AWS SAM.

### Other extension examples

* [Adaptive Batching extension in Go](go-example-adaptive-batching-extension/): How to use the Logs API extension written in Go to adaptively batch log data to a destination (S3). The logs are batched up and stored by the extension. Three environment variables with default values dictate when the logs are send to the destination. If any of the conditions are met, the logs queued will be shipped to S3.
  - `ADAPTIVE_BATCHING_EXTENSION_SHIP_RATE_BYTES`:  Logs are shipped to S3 once log size reaches the number of bytes defined
  - `ADAPTIVE_BATCHING_EXTENSION_SHIP_RATE_INVOKES`: Logs are shipped to S3 once the number of invokes reaches the number defined.
  - `ADAPTIVE_BATCHING_EXTENSION_SHIP_RATE_MILLISECONDS`: Logs are shipped to S3 once the amount of time elapsed since the last time logs were shipped is exceeded.

* [Inter-process communication extension in Go](go-example-ipc-extension/): A sample extension written in Go that acts as a companion process. The AWS Lambda function can communicate with the extension. This sample extension:

  - Writes to a file at `/tmp/test.txt` that the Lambda function can read.
  - Starts a local HTTP server at the provided port (default 2772) that replies to requests with "Hello from http server"

* [Crash uploader extension in Go](go-example-crash-uploader-extension/): A sample extension that looks for core dumps in the execution environment `/tmp` folder and uploads them to an Amazon S3 bucket for later inspection and troubleshooting.

### Wrapper script extension examples by language
* [Bash Wrapper script](bash-example-wrapper/): How to to get a wrapper script written in Bash up and running.

* [Python Wrapper script](python-example-wrapper/): How to to get a wrapper script written in Python up and running.
